# How do I use this webserver?

## Install expressJS (if you don't know how, this isn't for you.)

## Steps to setup folders:
### Make a "files" folder
### Add folders "file", "media" and "text"
### Fill out cfg.json to your liking

### This project is ShareX compatible, to use it with sharex just set the url parameters to secret with the secret value, the url with your url/[file,media,text], the method as POST, the body as Binary and the content type as application/json.

### To run the server, run yarn start
## Help out by starring this project, and contributing to the project, for any questions please dm me on discord @.diyara3 or open an issue.
### I also have a website running this: https://diyara3.space -- I sometimes post funny stuff here so excuse me.
